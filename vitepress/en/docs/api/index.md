## Why API Service Application is Needed

Saladict integrates numerous translation services by calling the open APIs of major translation providers. However, these service platforms require third-party software to apply and pay for using their services.

Taking Baidu Translate as an example, Baidu Translate provides two usage channels:

- [Web online version](https://fanyi.baidu.com/), Baidu Translate APP, and other forms officially released by Baidu Translate
- Translation API [https://fanyi-api.baidu.com/](https://fanyi-api.baidu.com/)

Although the web version / APP is free and directly usable, they are provided by Baidu officially and are limited to end users accessing through web browsers or installed APPs. As third-party software, Saladict can only use the translation API, which requires applying for an API key (you can think of it as something like an account password) on their platform before use.

However, these services all provide free usage quotas. Payment is only required after exceeding the free quota, but for personal use, the free quota is generally sufficient. For example, Baidu Translate provides 1 million characters of free quota per month.
