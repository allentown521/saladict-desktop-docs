## Pricing

Volcengine Translation offers the first 2 million characters free each month. Exceeding characters will be charged at 49 CNY per million characters. Fees are collected by Volcengine on their own Volcengine platform and are unrelated to Saladict.

Volcengine Translation is billed monthly, which means that even if you have used up the free quota within a natural month, Volcengine Translation will continue to deduct fees until the settlement at the beginning of the next month when a reminder will be given. Therefore, please closely monitor your monthly usage. If you want to receive notifications when Volcengine Translation deducts fees monthly, it is recommended to go to the Volcengine Billing Center to recharge 1 CNY, then set the available quota alert to 1 CNY. This way, you will receive a prompt when monthly deductions occur.

## Application Steps

Then, in the fourth step [Get Key], after clicking the [Create New Key] button, Volcengine provides two options:

<details><summary>Continue Creating (Create key using main account, more convenient but less secure)</summary>

After selecting [Continue Creating], a new row will appear in the table containing the [Access Key ID] and [Secret Access Key] that we need.

</details>
<details><summary>Create New Sub-user (Create key using sub-user, more secure but more complicated)</summary>
<p>

Omitted

</details>
