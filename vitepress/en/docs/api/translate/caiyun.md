## Pricing

Caiyun Translation offers the first 1 million characters free each month. Beyond that, charges are 20 yuan per million characters. The fees are charged by Caiyun Translation on their own Caiyun Technology Open Platform and are unrelated to Saladict.

Although not mentioned in the official documentation, Caiyun Translation appears to bill on a daily basis. If you use up your free quota, Caiyun Translation will stop working and return an error "Server returned error code 402". However, please note that daily billing means there won't be real-time notifications for usage within a day, and you'll only be notified during the daily settlement (usually around 1 AM).
