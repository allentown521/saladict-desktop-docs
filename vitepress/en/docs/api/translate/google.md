# Google Translate

Due to well-known reasons, Google servers cannot be accessed from mainland China, so 沙拉翻译 provides two solutions.

## Method 2: Use Mirror Site Address

Saladict provides custom domain settings. You can set a custom domain in the settings. By setting the custom domain to your mirror site address, you can connect to Google servers without using a proxy.

## Method 1: Enable Proxy

Set up an internal proxy in General Settings.

Leave the custom domain in Google service settings empty to use the official address.
