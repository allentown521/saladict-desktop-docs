# External Calls

Saladict provides a complete HTTP interface for integration with other software. You can call 沙拉翻译 by sending HTTP requests to `127.0.0.1:port`, where `port` is the listening port of pot, default to `60606`, and can be changed in the app settings.

## API Docs:

```bash
POST "/" => Translate given text (body is text to translate)
GET "/config" => Open settings
GET "/translate" => Translate given text (same as "/")
GET "/selection_translate" => Translate selected text
GET "/input_translate" => Open input translation
GET "/ocr_recognize" => Perform OCR on screenshot
GET "/ocr_translate" => Perform translation on screenshot
GET "/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false" => OCR without taking screenshot
GET "/ocr_translate?screenshot=false" => Translate screenshot without taking screenshot
GET "/ocr_recognize?screenshot=true" => OCR with screenshot
GET "/ocr_translate?screenshot=true" => Translate screenshot
```

## Example:

- Call translation by selection:

  To call pot's translation by selection, simply send a request to `127.0.0.1:port`:

  E.g. using curl:

  ```bash
  curl "127.0.0.1:60606/selection_translate"
  ```

## OCR without internal screenshot

This allows you to perform OCR/translation without using pot's internal screenshot, so you can use your own screenshot tools. It also solves the problem where pot's internal screenshot doesn't work on some platforms.

### Workflow:

1. Take screenshot using other tool
2. Save screenshot to `$CACHE/allen.town.focus.saladict/pot_screenshot_cut.png`
3. Send request to `127.0.0.1:port/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false` to call

:::info
`$CACHE` is the system cache dir, e.g. `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\allen.town.focus.saladict\pot_screenshot_cut.png` on Windows.
:::

### Example

OCR using Flameshot on Linux:

```bash
rm ~/.cache/allen.town.focus.saladict/pot_screenshot_cut.png && flameshot gui -s -p ~/.cache/allen.town.focus.saladict/pot_screenshot_cut.png && curl "127.0.0.1:60606/ocr_recognize?screenshot=false"
```
