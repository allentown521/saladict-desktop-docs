macOS 15 system prevents `Apps installed from the App Store` from using `option + letter/number` as shortcuts. If you are using these shortcuts, there are currently several solutions available.

## Solution 1: Upgrade to macOS 15.2 (Recommended)

Apple has fixed the issue of not being able to use `Option + letter` as shortcuts in macOS 15.2 Beta 2 (Build: 24C5073e). This means that only users with system versions between macOS 15.0 and macOS 15.2 Beta 2 are affected by this shortcut issue. Currently, it is recommended to upgrade to macOS 15.2 to resolve the problem.

## Solution 2: Modify Shortcuts

If you can accept not using `option + letter` shortcuts, you can modify the shortcuts to use other combinations like `control + letter`, `command + shift + letter`, etc., which will work normally.
