# How to Use Social Account Login

Saladict has been providing online translation services since version `V4.0.0`. You can directly access major AI providers and DeepL translation services through our platform.

If you are a Saladict extension user who registered with a social account and now want to use the same account to log in to the desktop application, or if you simply want to log in to the desktop application using a social account, follow these steps:

## Operation Steps

1. **Visit Official Website to Login**
   - Go to [Saladict Official Website](https://saladict.net/auth/login)
   - Log in with your social media account (Google, GitHub)

2. **Set Password**
   - After logging in, visit [Security Settings Page](https://saladict.net/settings/security)
   - Click the "Reset Password" button
   - Check your email for the password reset link and follow the instructions to complete password setup

3. **Desktop Application Login**
   - Open Saladict desktop application
   - Use the email address associated with your social account and the password you just set to log in

After completing the above steps, you can use the same account in the desktop application as in the extension version.

> **Note**: After setting a password, you can continue to log in using your social account or use the email + password method. Both methods are completely equivalent.
