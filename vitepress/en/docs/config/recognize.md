# Text Recognition Settings

## Recognition Language

Most recognition engines require specifying a recognition language. Some online engines support automatic language detection, so please consider whether to set it to automatic detection based on your needs. For recognition engines that don't support automatic detection, if set to automatic detection, they will automatically use Chinese or English for recognition.

## Auto Remove Line Breaks

Remove line breaks from the text after recognition is complete.

## Auto Copy

Automatically copy the recognition results after completion.

## Close Window on Blur

Automatically close the window when it loses focus.

## Hide Recognition Window

Works in conjunction with auto copy. When this option is enabled, the recognition window won't appear after taking a screenshot, and the results will be automatically copied to the clipboard after recognition is complete.
