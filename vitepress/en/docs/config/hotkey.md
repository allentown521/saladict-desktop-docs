# Hotkey Settings

The four basic functions of the software all support setting separate hotkeys.
Note that Saladict only supports standard key combinations and does not support non-standard shortcuts like double-clicks. This will not be supported in the future either. If needed, please use third-party key mapping tools to achieve this.

## Hotkey Setting Failed

### Wayland

Tauri's hotkey solution does not yet support Wayland, so the hotkey settings in Saladict cannot be used under Wayland. Please refer to [External Invocation](/en/docs/invoke.html) to use `curl` commands in system custom shortcuts to invoke Saladict.
