# General Settings

## Auto Start

Automatically start Saladict when system boots.

> Mac App Store version does not support this feature, but you can manually set it up, which is also very simple. Open the system settings, search for "login items", find "open at login", click the bottom left "+" button, add "Saladict", and you can achieve the startup at login. We will support this feature soon.

## Hide Icon in Dock

Hide the icon in the bottom Dock bar, including the translation window and settings window.

## Show Translation Icon When Text is Selected

Show the translation icon when text is selected. Click the translation icon to translate.

> This feature is experimental and not supported on Linux and Mac App Store versions. It is recommended to use the [Quick Selection Translate](/en/docs/quick-translate) feature.

## Application Language
