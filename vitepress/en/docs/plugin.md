# Plugin System

The built-in services are limited. But you can expand the app's functionality through the plugin system.

## Install Plugin

You can find plugins you need in the [Plugin List](/en/plugin), and then download it.

The file extension of pot plugin is `.potext`. After downloading the `.potext` file, go to `Config - Service Settings - Add Extension - Install Plugin` to select the corresponding `.potext` to install it. It will then be added to the service list and can be used like a built-in service.
