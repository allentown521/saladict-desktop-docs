# Quick Text Selection Translation

Although translating using `select text -> copy -> hotkey` is very convenient, some users prefer a more efficient method.

Therefore, Saladict also supports quick text selection translation, simplifying the operation to `select text -> quick button translation`, which is more efficient.
