Therefore, please closely monitor your monthly usage. If you want to be notified when Tencent Cloud makes monthly charges, it&#39;s recommended to top up 1 yuan in Tencent Cloud&#39;s billing center and set a cost alert for 1 yuan, so you&#39;ll receive notifications when monthly charges occur.</p><h2 id="application-steps" tabindex="-1">Application Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application Steps&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="step-1-complete-personal-verification" tabindex="-1">Step 1: Complete Personal Verification <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-complete-personal-verification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 1: Complete Personal Verification&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Before using Tencent Cloud Machine Translation, you need to complete personal verification.
