Saladict will only request this permission when you use related features.</p></li><li><p>Screen Recording Permission: This permission is used to capture specified screen areas for text recognition. Features like &quot;Screenshot Translation,&quot; &quot;Screenshot OCR,&quot; and &quot;Silent Screenshot OCR&quot; require this permission. Saladict will only request this permission when you use related features.</p></li><li><p>Automation Permission: This permission is used to control browsers to obtain currently selected text. Saladict will only request this permission when you use related features. This permission is optional.</p></li><li><p>Clipboard Read/Write: This permission is used to access currently selected text from the clipboard or write specified text to the clipboard.</p></li></ul><p>We do not save or share any data obtained through these permissions.</p><h2 id="data-collection" tabindex="-1">Data Collection <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-collection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Collection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Saladict does not collect core data generated during your usage, such as translated text and recognized images. If you enable services that require network requests, Saladict may send data to service providers&#39; servers for processing to obtain required results.</p><p>For example, if you enable the &quot;Baidu Translation&quot; service, when you translate text, Saladict will send the text data directly to Baidu Translation&#39;s servers for processing. This data does not pass through Saladict&#39;s servers, so we do not collect or share it.</p><p>If you enable text recognition services like &quot;Baidu OCR,&quot; when you use features like screenshot translation, Saladict will send images directly to Baidu OCR&#39;s servers for processing. This data also does not pass through Saladict&#39;s servers, and we do not collect or share it.</p><p>Additionally, when using certain service providers&#39; services, you may need to enter your own API keys into the Saladict main program for normal use. Saladict only saves your keys locally and never uploads them to servers.</p><p>However, to provide a better user experience, Saladict may collect the following data:</p><ul><li><p>Anonymized usage data. For example, the number of times text selection translation is used, but never the content being translated.</p></li><li><p>Crash data. To improve program stability, we collect information about program crashes.</p></li></ul><h2 id="changes-to-privacy-policy" tabindex="-1">Changes to Privacy Policy <a class="header-anchor" href="#changes-to-privacy-policy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Changes to Privacy Policy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time to reflect the latest situation with Saladict.
