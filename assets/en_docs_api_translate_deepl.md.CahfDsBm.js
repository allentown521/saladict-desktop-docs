Saladict can and only can use the developer version (DeepL API).</p><p>The developer version (DeepL API) has two tiers:</p><ul><li>Free (Recommended): Provides 500,000 free characters per month. Once exceeded, you cannot use it until the free quota refreshes next month.</li><li>Pro: No free quota. 25 USD per million characters, plus an additional monthly subscription fee of 5.49 USD.</li></ul><p>Note: Unlike domestic translation services, DeepL&#39;s free quota reset date is mid-month, typically on the 14th of each month. In other words, when domestic translation services reset their free quota on the first day of each month, DeepL has already been used for 16 days.</p><h2 id="application-steps" tabindex="-1">Application Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application Steps&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="step-1-obtain-a-deepl-account-with-api-access" tabindex="-1">Step 1: Obtain a DeepL Account with API Access <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-obtain-a-deepl-account-with-api-access" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 1: Obtain a DeepL Account with API Access&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you want to register a DeepL account and activate DeepL API yourself, you&#39;ll need a VISA/MASTER credit card issued in a country or region supported by DeepL. Currently, DeepL does not support activating DeepL API with credit cards issued in mainland China. Given this, I recommend purchasing an account that already has DeepL API Free activated online.</p><p>Again, please make sure you purchase an account with the developer version (DeepL API) activated, usually labeled with terms like &quot;Developer&quot; or &quot;API Free&quot;.</p><p>If you have an eligible credit card, you can register an account and activate DeepL API on the DeepL official website yourself. I cannot provide step-by-step instructions with images because I don&#39;t have a foreign credit card either 😂.</p><h3 id="step-2-get-the-auth-key" tabindex="-1">Step 2: Get the Auth Key <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-get-the-auth-key" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 2: Get the Auth Key&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once you have a DeepL API account:</p><ol><li>Open <a href="https://www.deepl.com/account/summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.deepl.com/account/summary</a></li><li>If you&#39;re not logged in, click [Login] in the top right corner and log in to your account.
