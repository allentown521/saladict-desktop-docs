After completing personal verification, you can switch to the Advanced version, which provides 1 million free characters per month. After using up the free quota, additional usage is charged at 49 yuan per million characters. The fees are charged by Baidu Translation on their own Baidu Translation Open Platform and are unrelated to Saladict.</p><p>It is recommended to enable &quot;Free Quota Usage Alert&quot; in My Services - General Text Translation on the Baidu Translation Platform. For example, if you have a free quota of 1 million characters, you can set the alert threshold to 900,000 characters. This way, when you consume 900,000 characters in the current month, Baidu Translation will notify you via SMS/email.</p><p>Baidu Translation bills on a daily basis. It is also recommended to top up 1 yuan on the Baidu Translation Open Platform and set up SMS alerts for when the balance falls below 1 yuan in the Financial Overview page. However, please note that daily billing means there won&#39;t be real-time notifications for usage within a day, and you&#39;ll only be notified during the daily settlement (usually around 1 AM).</p><h2 id="application-steps" tabindex="-1">Application Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application Steps&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="step-1-log-in-to-baidu-translation-open-platform" tabindex="-1">Step 1: Log in to Baidu Translation Open Platform <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-log-in-to-baidu-translation-open-platform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 1: Log in to Baidu Translation Open Platform&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Open the Baidu Translation Open Platform <a href="https://fanyi-api.baidu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://fanyi-api.baidu.com/</a> and log in to your Baidu account.
